My first small CodeNation project after succeeding in my interview with Orcha.

This project was following an article I had read the previous week using React Hooks & Router.

The article can be found here: https://medium.com/technest/build-a-react-app-using-basic-hooks-256060f59bba

This project was a personal project set by myself wanting to improve my skills and expose myself further to what React had to offer.
Here I learned more about React Hooks & Router and how they influence applications without classes.
